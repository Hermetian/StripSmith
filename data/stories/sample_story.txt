The Last Detective

Chapter 1: The Case

Rain hammered the city streets as Detective Sarah Chen stood in the alley. Her blonde hair was plastered to her face, green eyes scanning the crime scene. At thirty-five, she'd seen too many nights like this.

"Another one," her partner Jake Martinez said, approaching with an umbrella. Jake was in his forties, with graying hair and a weathered face that had seen twenty years on the force. His brown trench coat was already soaked.

Sarah knelt beside the body. "Same MO. Professional hit."

"The Commissioner won't like this," Jake said.

Sarah stood, her grey trench coat heavy with rain. "When does he ever?"

A black sedan pulled up at the alley entrance. Commissioner Rodriguez stepped out - a stern woman in her fifties with sharp features and silver-streaked dark hair pulled back tight.

"Chen. Martinez. My office. Now."

Chapter 2: The Lead

The Commissioner's office was all mahogany and authority. Rodriguez sat behind her massive desk, fingers steepled.

"This is the third victim this month," she said. "The Mayor is breathing down my neck."

Sarah leaned forward. "We have a lead. Security footage shows a figure near each scene."

"Show me."

Jake pulled up the footage on the wall screen. A hooded figure, face obscured, appeared in grainy black and white.

"That could be anyone," Rodriguez said.

"Look at the walk," Sarah pointed. "Military training. And that watch - expensive. Narrows it down."

Rodriguez's eyes sharpened. "Find them. You have forty-eight hours."

Chapter 3: The Chase

The warehouse district was dead at 2 AM. Sarah and Jake moved between shipping containers, weapons drawn.

"Police! Show yourself!" Sarah called.

A shadow moved. Then gunfire erupted.

"Down!" Jake dove behind a container. Sarah rolled, coming up firing.

The hooded figure sprinted for the fire escape. Sarah pursued, feet pounding metal stairs. The figure reached the roof and turned.

For one moment, they locked eyes. Then the figure jumped to the next building and disappeared into the night.

Sarah stood alone on the rooftop, rain streaming down. She'd gotten a glimpse of the face.

And she knew exactly who it was.
